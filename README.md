## Inspiration

When I applied to the Academy, there was an abundance of resources, but not much
focus. The process is complicated and intricate, which makes it difficult for
even the most qualified candidates to apply. 
This is intended to give an insightful and reflective view into the life and
mission of a candidate to the United States Naval Academy. Ideally, this may
help other future Naval Officers, in securing attendance to the Naval Academy.
At the very least, it will be a thoughtful and anfractuous story to follow.
